## Overview

## My process
used flexbox to keep everything centered and edited accordingly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

it was really hard to figure out how to center everything the way i wanted to. i tried all sorts of things. eventually i was able to figure out how to use flexbox to keep everything centered no matter what size the device/browser window was. i wish i could have figured out how to mess with the width of the container more, but it's not a big deal.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

still interested in learning more about flexbox. for some reason i find it confusing.
